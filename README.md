# stoptinnitus-PWA-AMP
Stop Tinnitus app intends to help tinnitus patient get rid of the noise. Please consult a doctor before using the app.

Stop Tinnitus web app uses PWA (to look and act as a mobile app) and AMP (to load the pages as fast as possible) technologies.

Known bugs so far:
- Does not play the sound on iOS (it will not work on Safari but it does not work on Chrome either)
- If app.html page reloads the player does not work
